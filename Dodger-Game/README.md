## Simple Dodger Game

### Description
This is a minimalistic 2D game where you control a circular player at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to avoid colliding with falling square obstacles from the top. Each collision deducts one life point.

### Gameplay
- The circular player can be moved horizontally using the mouse.
- Square obstacles (50px x 50px) fall from the top of the screen.
- Colliding with an obstacle results in losing one life point.
- The game continues until all life points are depleted.

Feel free to adjust the number of life points, obstacle speed, or any other parameters to suit your preferences. Remember, this is just a prototype, so focus on implementing the core mechanics. Good luck with your game development! ðŸŽ®ðŸš€
